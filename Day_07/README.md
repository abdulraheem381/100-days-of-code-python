## ✅ Today's Learnings

Today's focus was on building the **classic Hangman game**, combining all the concepts I've learned so far:

### 🧠 Key Concepts Covered:
- Breaking down complex problems into flowcharts before coding
- Splitting game logic into smaller, manageable parts
- Working with:
  - **Lists**
  - **Loops**
  - **Conditionals**
  - **String manipulation**
  - **User input**
  - **ASCII Art**
  - **Random word selection**
- Improving **user experience** (lives tracker, banners, input validation)

## 🕹 About the Game

The game selects a **random word** from a list of 100+ words. The player:
- Guesses one letter at a time
- Loses a life on each wrong guess
- Wins by guessing the full word before lives run out

The game includes:
- 🎮 Welcome Banner
- 💬 Lives and guess feedback
- ❌ Repeated input warning
- 🏆 Win/Lose banners
- 📌 Guessed letter tracking

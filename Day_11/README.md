# 🃏 100 Days of Code – Day 11: Blackjack Game

Welcome to Day 11 of my **#100DaysOfCode** challenge!  
Today’s project is a simple command-line **Blackjack (21) game** built using Python.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal was to practice:
- Conditional logic
- Functions and loops
- List operations
- Game logic implementation

Inspired by the real rules of Blackjack, this version lets you play against a computer dealer.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- Simulates a full round of Blackjack
- Dealer logic: draws until reaching 17 or more
- Handles Aces as either 1 or 11 automatically
- Allows player to draw multiple cards or stand
- Detects busts and Blackjack
- Clean and readable code

---

## 🧪 How to Play

1. Run the Python file in your terminal.
2. Your initial hand is dealt and shown.
3. Type `'y'` to draw another card or `'n'` to stand.
4. Dealer then plays automatically.
5. The winner is decided based on Blackjack rules.

## 📦 Requirements

Just Python! No external libraries needed.  
Tested with **Python 3.10+**

---

## 🚀 Running the Game

```bash
python blackjack.py
````

---

## 📸 Preview (Sample Output)

```
Your cards: [10, 7], current score: 17
Computer's first card: 9
Type 'y' to get another card, type 'n' to pass: y
Your final hand: [10, 7, 5], final score: 22
Computer's final hand: [9, 7], final score: 16
You went over. You lose! 😭
```

## 📚 What I Learned

* Managing state using functions
* Handling edge cases like multiple Aces
* Creating a better user experience via CLI
* Debugging logic errors in game flow

## 🔥 Next Step

In upcoming days, I’ll be building more interactive and logic-based games to further sharpen my Python skills.

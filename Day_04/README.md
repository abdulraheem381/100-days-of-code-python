# 🚀 Day 4 of 100 Days of Code – Python Lists & The Random Module

Today was all about exploring **how Python handles collections** and randomness — both critical for scripting logic, automation, and dynamic behavior in projects.

---

## 🔍 What I Learned Today

* 📦 What are **Modules** and how to import/use them
* 🎲 The power of the **`random` module** (randomization, choice, randint, etc.)
* 📋 Creating and modifying **Python Lists**
* 🤯 **Index errors** and how to debug them
* 🧩 **Nested Lists** and accessing elements
* 🧠 Built simple scripts using list and random logic

## 💻 Projects Built Today

### 💳 1. Who Will Pay the Bill?

Fun script that randomly selects a person from a list to pay the bill — ideal for team lunches 😄.

---

### ✊ 2. Rock Paper Scissors Game

A classic game implemented with:

* Player vs Computer logic
* Randomized opponent move
* Win/Lose/Draw logic using index-based comparisons

🔗 [View Project → `rock_paper_scissors.py`](./Game_rock_paper_scissors.py)

---

## 🎯 Reflection

It’s amazing how much **simple data structures + randomness** can make code feel alive. From automating choices to creating games — this is the kind of stuff that lays the foundation for **DevOps scripting**, **test case randomizers**, and more.

# 🚀 Day 2 of 100 Days of Code – Tip Calculator in Python

Welcome back to **Day 2** of my 100 Days of Code journey with Python!  
Today’s session focused on mastering **data types**, **type conversions**, and **math operations** — all fundamental building blocks for any automation or scripting work (including DevOps tasks!).

## 🔍 What I Learned Today

- 🔢 `len()` function to count characters
- 🧠 Primitive data types: `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`
- 🔎 `type()` function to inspect variable types
- 🎯 Indexing strings by character positions
- 🔄 Type casting / type conversion
- ➗ Mathematical operations & **PEMDAS** concept
- 🧮 `round()` for cleaner outputs
- 💡 Assignment operators like `+=`, `*=`, etc.
- 💬 f-Strings for clean, dynamic print formatting

## 💻 Final Project: Tip Calculator 🧾

Built a simple **Tip Calculator** that:
- Takes user input for bill, tip %, and number of people
- Calculates how much each person should pay

## 🎯 Reflection

I’m starting to feel more comfortable with Python syntax and problem-solving logic.  
Today’s learning helped me think like a script builder — especially using type conversion and f-strings, which are super useful in real-world DevOps scripting!

# 🚀 Day 3 of 100 Days of Code – Conditionals & Logic in Python

Today was all about **decision-making in code** using conditional logic — super important for writing scripts that behave differently based on user input or system state.

## 🔍 What I Learned Today

- ⚖️ Comparison Operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, etc.)
- 🔀 `if`, `else`, `elif` statements – conditional branching
- 🧩 Nested `if` statements – adding multiple layers of logic
- ➕ Multiple `if` statements (not just `elif`)
- 🔗 Logical Operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- 🧱 Clean and consistent indentation for logic blocks

## 💻 Projects Built Today

### 🎢 1. Roller Coaster Pass System
Simulates an amusement park pass logic based on:
- ✅ Height (must be ≥ 120cm)
- 💸 Age-based ticket pricing:
  - Under 12 → $5
  - 12–18 → $7
  - Over 18 → $12
- 📸 Optional photo for +$3
- 🧾 Outputs total bill

### 🍕 2. Pizza Price Calculator
Dynamic pizza billing based on:
- Size: S ($15), M ($20), L ($25)
- Pepperoni (+$2 for S, +$3 for M/L)
- Extra cheese (+$1)
- Returns final price based on all customizations.

### 🏝️ 3. Final Project – Treasure Island Game
A simple text-based adventure game using all learned concepts.  
The player makes decisions at each stage to reach the hidden treasure — or meet their doom 🪦.

## 🎯 Reflection

Today was seriously fun. Building condition-based logic like ticketing systems and billing calculators made it feel real. These skills will translate directly to writing **automation scripts**, **infrastructure rules**, and even **CI/CD pipeline conditions** in my DevOps journey.

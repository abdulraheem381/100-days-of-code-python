# 🚀 100 Days of Code: Python – Day 01

## 📚 What I Learned Today

Today marks **Day 1** of my Python journey with Dr. Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code Bootcamp. I dove into the very basics and picked up essential programming concepts that lay the foundation for all future progress.

### 🔑 Topics Covered:
- 📤 `print()` Function – displaying output
- 📝 Strings & String Manipulation
- 🔡 Escape Sequences (e.g., `\n`, `\"`)
- ➕ String Concatenation
- 🎯 `input()` Function – collecting user input
- ⚠️ Debugging: Indentation and Quotation Errors
- 📦 Variables – storing data
- 🧠 Best Practices for Naming Variables

---

## 🎯 Final Project – Band Name Generator 🎸

To wrap up Day 1, I built a simple yet fun **Band Name Generator** 💡 that takes user input and creates a cool band name based on it.

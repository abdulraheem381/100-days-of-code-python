# 🔁 Day 5 of 100 Days of Code – Mastering `for` Loops & Password Logic

Today was about **iteration, logic building, and generating dynamic content** — all fundamental to automation and real-world DevOps scripting.

---

## 📘 What I Learned Today

* 🔄 The basics of the **`for` loop**
* 🗃️ Using `for` loop with **Python Lists**
* ➕ Rewriting the built-in **`sum()`** function logic manually
* 🔢 Rebuilding the **`max()`** function using a loop
* 🎯 Exploring the **`range()`** function and its power in iteration

## 🔐 Final Project – Py Password Generator

Created a customizable password generator that:

* Accepts user input for length and complexity
* Randomly picks characters, numbers, and symbols
* Outputs a strong password for real-world usage

## 💬 Reflection

Loops are the heartbeat of automation. Whether it’s iterating over configs, parsing data, or generating secure passwords — today’s practice directly aligns with **DevOps workflows** and **Python scripting for cloud operations**.

# 🧠 Day 6 of 100 Days of Code – Functions & Reeborg’s Logic World

Today’s focus was on **breaking down logic into reusable blocks** with Python **functions** and mastering control flow with **`while` loops** — all while playing in the interactive **Reeborg’s World**.

## 🛠️ What I Learned Today

* 🧩 **Functions** – creating reusable code blocks
* 🕹️ Practiced everything in [**Reeborg’s World**](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html) – an interactive robot game to test logic
* 🔍 Mastered **indentation** – critical for clean Python code
* 🔁 Understood the **difference between `for` and `while` loops**
* 🎮 Solved multiple puzzles using loops + logic in Reeborg

## 🌍 No Final Project Today

All learning and challenges were completed inside the **Reeborg’s World** platform, so no standalone `.py` file for today.
